          <h2>about me.</h2>
          <p>Growing up I experienced two different households granting me the experience of living in multiple different places. Originally, I grew up in Florida before
            my Father moved us to Colorado, exposing me to a more tech-friendly industry. My Father would take me to his many jobs over the years, this I believe is where
            my inspiration to go after my own career within tech started. I am interested in digital-art, design, cyber-security, and working with start-ups.</p>
          <h2>about the site.</h2>
          <p>While designing this site I took inspiration from bright playful blogs, modern design, and rpg videogames. When it comes to my personal style of designing
          I always strive for a design that is both playful and functional. I take great inspiration from games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omori_(video_game)">Omori</a>
          early 2000s video game sites, and modern design.</p>
